# Contracts Management

## Syntex powered solutions to automate your contract needs
  
This SharePoint Syntex powered site is designed to help you jump-start your contract management needs. Use the Contracts Management site to let employees know about recent updates to agreements or policies, to give various departments an easy way to request a contract, and to provide a secure place to keep your organizationâ€™s contract templates.

The site also lets employees use preconfigured sample models to extract and classify information from documents, and to perform advanced searches to quickly find metadata within your agreements.
