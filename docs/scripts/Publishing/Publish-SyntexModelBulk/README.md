# Publish document understanding models in bulk #

## Summary

When document understanding models are created on a content center, they need to be published to specified libraries in order to process files.

This sample shows how to use a CSV file as an input to publish multiple models to various locations. This approach can be useful when you need to publish a high volume of models, or if there is a complex mapping of publishing required.
